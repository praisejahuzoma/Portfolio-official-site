# My Portfolio

Explore my portfolio website, featuring demos, resume, and GitHub repositories, showcasing my passion for web development and design.

## Usage
To view my portfolio locally or make changes to the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
* Node.js:  [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
  
## Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/praisejahuzoma/Portfolio-official-site.git

### Install Dependencies
1. Change into the cloned project directory:
   
       cd official-site

2. Install the required dependencies using npm:

       npm install

### Start the Development Server
 * Run the following command to start the development server:

       npm start

**This will start the React development server, and the portfolio website should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.**

### Build for Production
* To build the project for production, run the following command:
  
      npm run build


Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
